## Optimizations
To optimize this app, I would add a loading icon while all items are fetched and loaded into the DOM. This would make the app look much more professional because in the current iteration some items load in quicker than others. In future iterations I would like to add more content to the webpage, including the Pokemon's evolution tree. I would also like to add more content to the front page of the site, as the current page looks pretty bland.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this app enhanced my understanding of API fetches and how to process the data that is retrived from an API.
